# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Wednesday October 16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I have been working on the FreeCodeCamp core curriculum for about a month now. Today I focused on learning intermediate CSS by doing a cat painting.

**Thoughts:** Está canijo CSS, pero poco a poco me voy sintiendo más cómodo al trabajar.

### Day 1: Thursday October 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
